Welcome to my new project--Arduino-based ROV!

This project contains two Arduino sketches, one to run an Arduino Pro Mini inside the ROV itself
and another to run an Arduino Duemilanove inside the surface electronics unit.

Included also are PDF schematics of the electronics found in the ROV and in the surface unit.
